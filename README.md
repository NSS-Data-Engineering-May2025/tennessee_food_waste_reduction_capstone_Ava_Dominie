# tennessee_food_waste_reduction_capstone_Ava_Dominie
To support predictive insights for Tennessee’s food supply chain, this project integrates historical crop data, current weather conditions, and simple yield modeling. County-level data from USDA NASS Quick Stats—including crop yield, production, and acres harvested—provides a historical baseline of expected crop output. Weather data from the Open-Meteo API, including temperature and precipitation, is used to adjust these expectations for current environmental conditions, as weather has a direct impact on crop growth and yield. Finally, the NASS “Yield” column is used for simple historical yield modeling, serving as a transparent and reliable benchmark. By combining these datasets, the pipeline can generate actionable forecasts of potential overstock or understock situations, helping suppliers, retailers, and policymakers reduce food waste and optimize distribution.
